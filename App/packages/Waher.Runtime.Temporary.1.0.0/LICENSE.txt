IoTGateway License
=========================

You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using this software. Your use of this software indicates your acceptance of this license agreement and warranty. If you do not agree with the terms of this license, or if the terms of this license contradict with your local laws, you must remove any files from the **IoT Gateway** from your storage devices and cease to use it. The terms of this license are subjects of changes in future versions of the IoT Gateway.

You may not use, copy, emulate, clone, rent, lease, sell, modify, decompile, disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or transfer the licensed program, or any subset of the licensed program, except as provided for in this agreement.  Any such unauthorised use shall result in immediate and automatic termination of this license and may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution.

The source code [1] and libraries provided in this repository is provided open for the following uses:

* For Personal evaluation. Personal evaluation means evaluating the code, its libraries and underlying technologies, including learning about underlying technologies.

* For Academic use. If you want to use the following code for academic use, all you need to do is to inform the author of who you are, what academic institution you work for (or study for), and in what projects you intend to use the code. All that is asked in return is for an acknowledgement and visible attribution to this repository, including a link, and that you do not redistribute the source code, or parts thereof in the solutions you develop. If any solutions developed in an academic setting, become commercial, it will need a commercial license.

* For Security analysis. If you perform any security analysis on the code, to see what security aspects the code might have, all that is asked of you, is that you inform the author of any findings at least forty-five days before publication of the findings, so that any vulnerabilities might be addressed. Such contributions are much appreciated and will be acknowledged.

Commercial use of the code, in part or in full, in compiled binary form, or its source code, requires a Commercial License. Contact the author for details.

Note: Distribution of code in source or compiled form, for purposes other than mentioned above, is not considered personal use and requires a commercial license, even if distribution is made under an apparently free license. It facilitates the development of competing software, without the investment in actually performing the corresponding coding. It also can make the use of the original libraries obsolete, as free code apparently doing the same, based on the original libraries, would be available under an apparently free license. (Thus, making distribution free does not mitigate this effect.) Developers using the libraries to enhance their own projects (brands, offerings or businesses, even if the software itself is free), should therefore consider sponsoring the development of such software. It is the express intent of the developer of these libraries to create libraries that facilitate the development of great software for IoT. Also, the commercial license includes options to request customizations of the libraries.

If you're interested in using the source code, as a whole, or in part, you need a license agreement with the author. You can contact him through LinkedIn.
